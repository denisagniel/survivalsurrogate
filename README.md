`survivalsurrogate` is an `R` package with influence function-based methods to evaluate a longitudinal surrogate marker in a censored time-to-event outcome setting, with plug-in and targeted minimum loss-based estimation options.

More details will be available in the future in: Agniel D and Parast L (2025). "Robust Evaluation of Longitudinal Surrogate Markers with Censored Data." Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B, 87(3): 891-907. 

Go here to view a tutorial for this package: [survivalsurrogate Tutorial](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denisagniel/survivalsurrogate/refs/heads/master/survivalsurrogate_tutorial.html). We also have a shiny app implementing these methods [here](https://parastlab.shinyapps.io/survivalsurrogateApp/).
